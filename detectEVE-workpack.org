#+DESCRIPTION: 


* Changes compared to slequime's legacy

- rvdb80 (80% clustered with cd-hit; min-length 60aa) instead of
  VDB/VDB80.
  - Latest version automatically downloaded from source at
  Pasteur.
  - Annotated with NCBI-tax
  - filtering is done in diamond using --taxonlist / --taxon-exclude to control
    which viral groups to scan for

- EVE min_length: 83 amino-acids (250 bp in tblastn)

- =diamond blastx= instead of =tblastn=
  - =diamond= is used in frameshift mode to can extend hits across frameshifts;
  dropped merging of abutting =tblastn= hits from orig pipeline
  - =diamond= uses tantan
  mask, which gets rid of low-complexity region, such as Proline/Serine linkers
  Ig side chains
  - need to chop long contigs for diamond or else I lose hits (50k + 10k overlap
  windows). Creates possibility of redundant hits right at window edge (could be
  filtered?)

- retroblast with uniref50 + rvdb80 instead of NR
  - faster, less redundant, more viral hits
  - --top 20 (top hits within 20% top score, rather than strict -k 10 top hits)

* Questions & Notes
- lots of putatEVEs are low-complexity repeats - meaningful? 
  - [I'm now tantan masking VDB which gets rid of most of these low-complexity hits (Ig side chain
  stuff, PSSPSPSS linker, ...)]
  - I'm now using tantan masking in diamond which gets rid of most of these low-complexity hits

- [-] currently I'm not filtering out retroviral hits - but we probably should?
  - [X] can now be filtered in search via damond taxonlist/taxon-exclude
  - [ ] but might also filter retro hits after retroblast?

- [X] are validatEVEs just subset of putatEVEs or somehow extracted based on
  retroblast results? - YES

- CLI TODOs
  - [X] analysis
  - [X] setup
  - [X] document in README
  - [ ] test setup, custom DBs, ...

- [X] summarize output of multiple genomes
- [ ] summarize across runs?

- [ ] conda/mamba for entire package (not just deps)

- [ ] do we want place/download ready-to-go databases on figshare, rather than
  setting them up from scratch on every install? Figshare might be robuster, but
  needs us to keep databases up-to-date
